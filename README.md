# Printf---42
A project from 42 silicon Valley

The project's purpose is to recreate most of the printf specifiers and flags as well as to stregthen fundamentals in a simpel algorithim.

I'm also currently in the midst of redoing the project so that the code is cleaner and more readable, as well as simply improving the exsisting code.
